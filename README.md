# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made us C# and .NET Framework

## Projects:


### [Car Insurance Calculator](https://github.com/taylor-peters/CarInsurance2)
As one of the final assignments for our C# course, we utilized MVC to take in a user's input, caluclate their insurance rate, print the data back to the screen, and create an Admin page to see all database entries.

### [Code-First Student App](https://github.com/taylor-peters/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/FinalChallenge)
Construced a simple, Code-First app that instantiated a new database when run.
